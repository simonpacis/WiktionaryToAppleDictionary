# Wiktionary to Apple Dictionary
I'm slowly working my way through converting Wiktionary dumps to the proprietary Apple Dictionary format.
You can download and install the ones I've done from here.

## Usage
Download a specific dictionary folder and cd to it on the commandline.
Then run the command "make install" to install the dictionary.
Restart Dictionary.app, go to Preferences and enable the new dictionary.

## Languages
