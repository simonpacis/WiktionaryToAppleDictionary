# Wiktionary to Apple Dictionary
I'm slowly working my way through converting Wiktionary dumps to the proprietary Apple Dictionary format.
You can download and install the ones I've done from here.

## Usage
Download a specific Dictionary from the table below.
Extracrt it and cd to it in the Terminal.

Then run the command "make install" to install the dictionary.
Restart Dictionary.app, go to Preferences and enable the new dictionary.

## Downloads

Please open an issue if there's a specific dictionary you're looking for that is not yet supported.
